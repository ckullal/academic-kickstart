Chaitanya Ullal is an Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He got his Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering at MIT and did a post-doc in the lab of Stefan Hell, at the MPI-BPC in Goettingen, Germany. He is a recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, an ACS PRF New Investigator Award, and the 2020 Eastern NY Alfred H. Geisler Memorial Award. His research interests are related to polymers, unconventional nanolithography, and optics. A current emphasis of his work is the imaging and patterning  of 3D nanostructured polymers via superresolution optics, which circumvents the diffraction barrier and achieves nanoscale resolutions while using visible light and far-field optics.
