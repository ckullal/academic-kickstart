Our research dream is to “dial in” material properties of 3D nanostructured bulk materials through precise fabrication and characterization of polymers. The consistent themes of our research are polymers, unconventional nanolithography, and optics. A unique strength of our group is the use of <span style="color: red;">super-resolution optics</span>, i.e. the ability of far field optical microscopy and lithography to circumvent the diffraction barrier and achieve nanoscale resolutions with visible light. Through our recent and ongoing contributions, we seek to establish research leadership in the application of super-resolution optics to reveal and control the 3D morphology of nanostructured polymers and gels.
